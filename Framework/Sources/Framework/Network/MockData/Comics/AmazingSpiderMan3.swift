        Spider-Man catches Charlie and his two pals robbing a warehouse. Surprising them with his Spider \
        Signal light, he quickly overcomes them and webs them up for the police. Meanwhile, atomic scientist \
        Otto Octavius, known to his colleagues as Doctor Octopus because of the unique set of four \
        remote-controlled arms he invented for handling radioactive material, is hard at work at the \
        U.S. Atomic Research Center. Suddenly his experiment goes awry. In the ensuing explosion, Otto \
        Octavius's mechanical arms fuse to his body, and the excess radiation alters his brain. When he \
        awakens at Bliss Private Hospital, he discovers that he can make his mechanical arms move by thought \
        alone, just as if they were his real arms. With his brain unbalanced, Dr. Octopus forcibly takes over \
        the hospital as his first criminal act.
