        New York City is being terrorized by a new criminal called the Vulture. He is equipped with \
        artificial wings that allow him to swoop down on his victims, snatch their valuables, and fly \
        away before they know what is happening. Nobody has been able to photograph him, and J. Jonah \
        Jameson needs pictures to illustrate his Vulture feature article for NOW Magazine. Peter Parker \
        decides to try to photograph the criminal in action. Selling the photographs will help him and \
        his Aunt May make ends meet.
