        Spider-Man sees a few punks casing a jewelry store and webs them up before they can rob it. \
        However, the thugs threaten to sue Spider-Man for assault and battery! Spider-Man must flee \
        when they call the cops, since all the evidence makes him look guilty. Spider-Man blames Jameson \
        for this treatment and leaves him a little souvenir in his office. After leaving Jameson's office, \
        Spider-Man runs into the Sandman on a rooftop. Sandman gets the best of Spider-Man, and Spider-Man's \
        mask is torn in the process, so he must flee before his identity is revealed. While at home sewing up \
        his mask, Peter Parker learns the identity of the Sandman during a news bulletin. Originally an escaped \
        convict, Sandman hid on a beach at a radioactive testing facility. During one of the tests, he was \
        exposed to radioactivity, and his body gained the power to act as if it were made of sand. The bulletin \
        also shows Sandman robbing a bank and fleeing the police.
