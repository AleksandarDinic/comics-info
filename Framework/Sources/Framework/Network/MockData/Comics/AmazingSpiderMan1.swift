        With the Parker household desperate for money following the death of Ben Parker, Peter Parker \
        decides to continue in show business as Spider-Man. However, not only does he find it impossible \
        to cash his paycheck (made out to Spider-Man), but the irrational editorials by J. Jonah Jameson \
        in the Daily Bugle effectively quelch his career. Besides denouncing Spider-Man as a \
        publicity-seeking phony, J. Jonah Jameson also publishes articles lauding his son, John Jameson, \
        a courageous astronaut about to be launched into orbit in a space capsule. J. Jonah Jameson calls \
        his son a real hero.
